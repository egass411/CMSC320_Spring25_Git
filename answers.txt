Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
Answer: Git allows for easy collaboration between multiple people. Branches
allow people to work on a differrent part of the project on their own, while
others work on the rest of the project. It also allows you to track changes 
in the code overtime and saves the old versions of the code if you want to
revert any changes.
